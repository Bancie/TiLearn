# Minimization of Maximum Lateness $(L_{\max})$

As mentioned earlier, the goal of Minimization of Maximum Lateness $(L_{\max})$ problem prioritizes tasks with the **earliest due dates**, ensuring they are completed first to reduce the chances of delays and minimize $L_{\max}$.

## EDD Algorithm

The **EDD (Earliest Due Date)** algorithm is a popular and effective single-machine scheduling technique aimed at minimizing maximum lateness $L_{\max}$.

## Independence jobs
