# The Maximum Lateness $(L_{\max})$
## What is main goal?

- Basically, it prioritizes tasks with the **earliest due dates**, ensuring they are completed first to reduce the chances of delays and minimize $L_{\max}$.
- The **EDD (Earliest Due Date)** algorithm is a popular and effective single-machine scheduling technique aimed at minimizing maximum lateness $L_{\max}$.
