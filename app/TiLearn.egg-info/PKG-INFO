Welcome to our open-source project focused on applying **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to **Machine Scheduling** and **Time Management**, often referred to as **Optimal Processing**. Our goal is to revolutionize the way tasks and processes are managed in various projects by leveraging advanced computational methods to optimize efficiency and productivity.

# Installation

To install TiLearn using PyPI, run the following command:

```
pip install TiLearn
```

Then, in the TiLearn repository that you cloned, simply run:

```
pip install .
```


# Documentation and Usage

# Project Goals

- **Optimized Scheduling**: Develop algorithms that can create optimal schedules for machines, minimizing downtime and maximizing throughput.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Implement predictive models to foresee and mitigate potential machine failures, ensuring continuous and efficient operations.
- **Time Management**: Utilize deep learning models to enhance time management practices, helping businesses or individuals and team allocate resources more effectively and meet deadlines.
- **Scalability**: Design solutions that are scalable and adaptable to different industrial environments and varying sizes of operations.

# Responsibilities

As part of this open-source project, contributors are encouraged to:

- **Algorithm Development**: Create and refine machine learning and deep learning algorithms tailored to scheduling and time management.
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and preprocess data from various sources to train and validate models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train models using the collected data and evaluate their performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Integration and Testing**: Integrate developed models into real-world scheduling systems and conduct extensive testing to validate their effectiveness.
- **Documentation and Support**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the project, providing clear guidelines for usage and contribution. Assist users and other contributors through forums and issue tracking.
